Description: variantMapper allows users to assign variants of interest a 
    prediction of pathogenicity by using the evolutionary model of variant 
    effect (EVE).  It can assign pathogenicity predictions to missense variants 
    and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in both protein and genomic form.  
    varaintMapper also provides functionality to visualize EVE scores for a 
    variant of interest against the corresponding gene.  Up to two variants can 
    be visualized at one time against the gene of interest.
